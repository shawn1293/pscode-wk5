// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

- Get the number from the user.
- Check if the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is 0.
- If the remainder is 0, the number is even.
- If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd.


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

- Declare an array to store the five numbers.
- Declare variables to store the sum, average, minimum, and maximum values.
- Initialize the sum to 0.
- Loop to read five numbers.
- Read a number and store it in the array.
- Add the number to the sum.
- Calculate the average.
- Initialize the minimum and maximum with the first number.
- Loop to find the minimum and maximum values.
- Update the minimum if the current number is smaller.
- Update the maximum if the current number is larger.
- Print the average, minimum, and maximum values with descriptive messages.
